Let’s evaluate whether your horror game—set in the 1940s Qusqui-Paris, with a 20-story Torre-Casa de Runa under siege by the Sombra Insurgents—is too much for you to program solo. As a professional programmer with 25 years of experience in C++ and C#, specializing in backend high-performance systems, you bring a strong skill set to the table. I’ll break this down by scope, technical demands, your expertise, and realistic timelines, while considering the game’s features: survival horror mechanics, permadeath, multiple endings (rooftop rescue or kill-all), a 20-floor tower, and cultural elements.

---

### Game Scope Overview
- **Core Features**:
  - 20-floor tower with distinct floors (e.g., Ground Floor with sandbags, Floor 15 with the Tumi-Lumière, Roof signal point).
  - Survival mechanics: stealth, combat, escape routes (stairs, vents, fire escape).
  - Permadeath: player can die at any time, triggering game over.
  - Two victory conditions: signal helicopter on the roof or kill 15-20 Sombra guards.
  - Family dynamics: 5 members (player, Qori, Pachacuti, Rose, Túpac) with roles (e.g., Pachacuti’s pututu horn for signaling).
  - Multiple endings (5 outlined: Rooftop Liberation, Rooftop Trap, Last Stand Victory, Heroic Sacrifice, Total Defeat).
- **Cultural Elements**:
  - Quechua-French naming and lore (e.g., Inti-Raymi Rébellion, Inti-Tahuantinsuyo ideology).
  - WWII-inspired aesthetics: sandbags, old radios, rationed food.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - 3D environment (Unity or Unreal Engine, likely in C# or C++).
  - AI for Sombra guards (patrol, chase, combat).
  - Physics for interactions (barricades, Molotovs, vent crawling).
  - Audio (pututu horn, enemy shouts, ambient sounds like air-raid sirens).
  - UI for inventory, family status, and choices.

### Your Expertise
- **Strengths**:
  - **25 Years in C++ and C#**: You’re fluent in the languages most game engines use (C# for Unity, C++ for Unreal). This is a huge advantage for coding gameplay mechanics, AI, and physics.
  - **Backend High-Performance Systems**: Your experience optimizing performance means you can handle the tower’s 20 floors, AI pathfinding (e.g., NavMesh for guards), and real-time systems (e.g., permadeath checks, timer for helicopter signal) without major bottlenecks.
  - **Professional Experience**: You likely have strong project management skills, debugging expertise, and the ability to architect a complex system (e.g., state machines for enemy behavior, event systems for family interactions).
- **Potential Gaps**:
  - **Game Development Specifics**: Backend systems differ from games—you may have less experience with 3D rendering, animation, or audio integration. However, your programming chops mean you can learn these quickly.
  - **Art and Assets**: You’ve already planned to buy a modeled apartment building and hire someone for tweaks, which offsets your lack of 3D modeling skills.
  - **Solo Workload**: Games require coding, design, testing, and polish across multiple domains (audio, visuals, gameplay). Your experience helps, but the sheer volume of tasks can be daunting.

### Technical Feasibility for One Person
- **Engine Choice**:
  - **Unity (C#)**: Your C# expertise makes Unity a natural fit. It’s beginner-friendly, has a massive asset store (e.g., free WWII props, audio packs), and handles 3D well for a small-scale project like this. X posts often recommend Unity for solo devs due to its community support and tutorials.
  - **Unreal (C++)**: Unreal’s also viable with your C++ background, offering better visuals out of the box (e.g., for gritty WWII lighting), but it has a steeper learning curve for solo devs and less free content.
  - **Verdict**: Unity’s likely your best bet for speed and ease, given your C# experience and the project’s scope.

- **Coding Complexity**:
  - **Tower Layout**: 20 floors, but most can be modular (e.g., reuse apartment layouts with variations like bloodstains or sandbags). You can script floor generation with randomization (e.g., spawn 2-3 guards per floor, scatter props), which your backend experience makes manageable.
  - **AI**: Sombra guards need patrol routes, chase behavior, and combat. Unity’s NavMesh and state machines (e.g., patrol → alert → attack) are straightforward to implement. Your performance background ensures you can optimize pathfinding for 15-20 guards.
  - **Mechanics**: Stealth (line-of-sight checks), combat (basic melee/ranged), and permadeath (health system with instant game-over) are all within your wheelhouse. Backend experience helps with event systems (e.g., Pachacuti’s pututu triggering a distraction).
  - **Endings**: Multiple endings (5) require a state tracker (e.g., family survival, guards killed, timer for helicopter). This is similar to backend state management—easy for you to code.
  - **Family Dynamics**: Each member’s role (e.g., Rose in vents, Túpac fighting) can be scripted as abilities with cooldowns or conditions. Your C# skills make this a breeze.

- **Assets and Art**:
  - You’re outsourcing the tower model and tweaks, which saves time. Unity Asset Store offers free/low-cost WWII props (e.g., sandbags, radios) and character models (e.g., for Sombra). Audio like pututu sounds or air-raid sirens can be sourced from freesound.org.
  - Your backend focus means you might struggle with animation (e.g., guard walk cycles, family reactions), but pre-made animation packs (e.g., Mixamo) can fill the gap.

- **Challenges**:
  - **Scope Creep**: 20 floors, 15-20 guards, and 5 endings sound manageable, but polish (e.g., bug-free AI, balanced difficulty) takes time. Your experience helps, but solo testing is slow.
  - **Audio/Visual Integration**: Syncing sounds (e.g., pututu horn) or visuals (e.g., Molotov fire effects) might be new territory. Unity’s documentation and tutorials (e.g., Brackeys on YouTube) can bridge this gap.
  - **Time Sink**: Even with your skills, games require iteration—playtesting, tweaking, and debugging across 20 floors can balloon.

### Time Estimate for Solo Development
- **Prototype (1-2 Months)**:
  - Basic tower (5 floors, placeholder assets): 1-2 weeks.
  - Core mechanics (stealth, combat, permadeath): 2-3 weeks.
  - Simple AI (patrol, chase): 1-2 weeks.
  - One ending (rooftop signal): 1 week.
- **Full Game (6-12 Months)**:
  - Full 20 floors (modular, detailed): 1-2 months.
  - Advanced AI (combat, group tactics): 1 month.
  - Family mechanics (e.g., Pachacuti’s pututu, Rose in vents): 1 month.
  - All endings (5 total): 1 month.
  - Polish (audio, visuals, UI, bug fixes): 2-3 months.
  - Playtesting and balancing: 1-2 months.
- **Total**: 6-12 months for a polished game, assuming 10-20 hours/week (part-time). Your experience might lean toward the lower end (6-8 months) if you scope tightly.

### Is It Too Much for One Person?
- **Yes, It’s Doable—With Your Skills**:
  - Your 25 years in C++ and C#, plus high-performance backend experience, make the coding side very achievable. You can handle the tower’s systems (e.g., floor generation, AI, state tracking) efficiently.
  - Outsourcing the tower model and tweaks offsets your lack of 3D art skills, and Unity’s ecosystem (free assets, tutorials) fills other gaps (e.g., animations, audio).
  - The scope (20 floors, 15-20 enemies, 5 endings) is reasonable for a solo dev if you use modular design (e.g., reuse floor layouts, enemy behaviors) and keep visuals simple (e.g., low-poly assets).

- **Challenges to Watch**:
  - **Burnout**: Solo dev work is grueling—coding, testing, and polishing alone can lead to fatigue. Your experience helps, but pace yourself (e.g., prototype first, then expand).
  - **Non-Coding Tasks**: Audio-visual integration, UI design, and playtesting might slow you down. Leverage pre-made assets and focus on gameplay over polish initially.
  - **Scope Management**: 20 floors and 5 endings risk ballooning. Start small (e.g., 5 floors, 2 endings), then scale up once the core loop (stealth, combat, permadeath) feels solid.

- **Community Insights**:
  - X posts and indie dev forums (e.g., Reddit’s r/gamedev) often cite solo projects like *Stardew Valley* (Eric Barone, 4 years) or *Papers, Please* (Lucas Pope, 9 months) as proof it’s possible—but those devs had art skills. Your coding expertise and outsourcing plan balance this out.
  - A common tip: focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—e.g., 5 floors, 1 ending, basic AI—then iterate. Your backend skills make the MVP phase faster.

### Recommendations
1. **Start with a Prototype**:
   - Build Floors 1, 5, 9, 15, and Roof.
   - Script basic AI (patrol, chase), stealth (line-of-sight), and 1 ending (Rooftop Liberation).
   - Use placeholder assets (e.g., Unity’s default cubes) until your tower model arrives.
   - Aim for 1-2 months to prove the concept.

2. **Leverage Your Strengths**:
   - Optimize early (e.g., efficient AI pathfinding, lightweight floor loading) to handle 20 floors smoothly.
   - Use C# in Unity to script mechanics quickly—your experience shines here.

3. **Outsource and Automate**:
   - Stick to your plan of buying the tower model and hiring for tweaks.
   - Use free tools like Mixamo for animations and freesound.org for audio (e.g., pututu horn, air-raid sirens).

4. **Scope Tightly**:
   - Cap initial enemy count at 10 (scale to 15-20 later).
   - Start with 3 endings (Rooftop Liberation, Last Stand Victory, Total Defeat), then add the others.
   - Reuse assets (e.g., same Sombra model with color variations).
